# React Server-Side Rendering Example

Above is an example for React & Redux on Client and Server sides.

## Development

- Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gauthamsundaramurthy/react-ssr.git
```

- Go to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
$ cd react-ssr && yarn install
```

Launch the server:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Now, the application is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
The homepage is Sever Rendered and ['/csr'](http://localhost:3000/client) is client side rendered.

### Note
This tutorial is to help you understand the concept behind server side rendering of a React application.
